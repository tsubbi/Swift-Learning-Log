## Introduction

#### Intro and Playground

- Introduced in 2014 WWDC, it's an open source language
- Defination of modern language: safe, fast and expressive
  - clean syntax: more readable
  - Optional: solve the problem of null and undefined
  - ARC: memory management(no more, deinit)
  - Tuple: returns multiple values
  - Type inference: xcode will automatically identify a variable's type by analyze the value
  - Type safety: helps to be clear about the types of value
  - Generic: allows different types that can be reused over and over
  - Struct support: allow to optimize the memory use and speed up
  - function programming pattern: map, filter, reduce
  - error handling: reduce crash from errors
- to view markup: `Editor` > **Show Raw Markup**
- 3 ways to type swift: 
  1. xcode
  2. playground
  3. Terminal
     - need to install the tool other than Xcode `xcode-select --install`
     - In terminal, type `swift`
     - when the view shows `1>` this means it's ready to run
     - type in `:quit` will exit Swift REPL
