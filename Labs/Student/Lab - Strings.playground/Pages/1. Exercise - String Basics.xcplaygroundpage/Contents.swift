 Create a `favoriteQuote` constant and assign it the following string literal:
 
 - "My favorite quote is <INSERT QUOTE HERE>."
 
 Write in your own favorite quote where indicated, and be sure to include escaped quotation marks. When finished, print the value of `favoriteQuote`.

 - callout(Example): If your favorite quote is "The grass is always greener on the other side" the value of `favoriteQuote` should be such that printing `favoriteQuote` results in the following:
    * `My favorite quote is "The grass is always greener on the other side."`
